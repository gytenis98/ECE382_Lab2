###Subroutines - "Cryptography"

![cryptography](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gytenis98/ECE382_Lab2/master/encryption2.jpg?raw=true "cryptography")

##Objectives

To create a program able to decrypt message using subroutines on the MSP430 board

##Required Functionality (done)

•The encrypted and decrypted message will be in memory locations. The encrypted message and key will be stored in ROM - any location in ROM is acceptable. The message will be of arbitrary length, but the key will be one byte long. The decrypted message will be stored in RAM starting at 0x0200. Labels shall be used to to refer to the location of the encrypted message, decrypted message, and key.
•The key and encrypted message will be given to you. You can tell how long the message is by counting the bytes.
•Good coding standards, in accordance with the Lab guidelines, must be used throughout.

Encrypted Message:
0xef,0xc3,0xc2,0xcb,0xde,0xcd,0xd8,0xd9,0xc0,0xcd,0xd8,0xc5,0xc3,0xc2,0xdf,0x8d,0x8c,0x8c,0xf5,0xc3,0xd9,0x8c,0xc8,0xc9,0xcf,0xde,0xd5,0xdc,0xd8,0xc9,0xc8,0x8c,0xd8,0xc4,0xc9,0x8c,0xe9,0xef,0xe9,0x9f,0x94,0x9e,0x8c,0xc4,0xc5,0xc8,0xc8,0xc9,0xc2,0x8c,0xc1,0xc9,0xdf,0xdf,0xcd,0xcb,0xc9,0x8c,0xcd,0xc2,0xc8,0x8c,0xcd,0xcf,0xc4,0xc5,0xc9,0xda,0xc9,0xc8,0x8c,0xde,0xc9,0xdd,0xd9,0xc5,0xde,0xc9,0xc8,0x8c,0xca,0xd9,0xc2,0xcf,0xd8,0xc5,0xc3,0xc2,0xcd,0xc0,0xc5,0xd8,0xd5,0x8f

Key: 0xac


##B Functionality (done)

In addition to the Required Functionality, your program must decrypt messages with arbitrarily long keys. The keys are arbitrarily long series of bytes.

The length of the key should be a parameter passed into your subroutine. You know the length of the key in advance.

Your subroutines don't have to exclusively pass-by-reference or pass-by-value - it's perfectly acceptable to make a subroutine that uses both.

Encrypted Message:
0xf8,0xb7,0x46,0x8c,0xb2,0x46,0xdf,0xac,0x42,0xcb,0xba,0x03,0xc7,0xba,0x5a,0x8c,0xb3,0x46,0xc2,0xb8,0x57,0xc4,0xff,0x4a,0xdf,0xff,0x12,0x9a,0xff,0x41,0xc5,0xab,0x50,0x82,0xff,0x03,0xe5,0xab,0x03,0xc3,0xb1,0x4f,0xd5,0xff,0x40,0xc3,0xb1,0x57,0xcd,0xb6,0x4d,0xdf,0xff,0x4f,0xc9,0xab,0x57,0xc9,0xad,0x50,0x80,0xff,0x53,0xc9,0xad,0x4a,0xc3,0xbb,0x50,0x80,0xff,0x42,0xc2,0xbb,0x03,0xdf,0xaf,0x42,0xcf,0xba,0x50,0x8f

Key: 0xacdf23


##A Functionality (Could not make it work)

In addition to B Functionality, you must decrypt the following message without knowledge of its key:

There are many ways to attack this problem. Some techniques require substantially more CPU time than others. Some techniques can be done by hand. Take the time to think through your approach before you begin coding.

0x35,0xdf,0x00,0xca,0x5d,0x9e,0x3d,0xdb,0x12,0xca,0x5d,0x9e,0x32,0xc8,0x16,0xcc,0x12,0xd9,0x16,0x90,0x53,0xf8,0x01,0xd7,0x16,0xd0,0x17,0xd2,0x0a,0x90,0x53,0xf9,0x1c,0xd1,0x17,0x90,0x53,0xf9,0x1c,0xd1,0x17,0x90


##Debugging

Had some problems with incrementing again. it was storing values in the wrong place at first. I looked at few examples in the internet as well as in other people works and finally made it work. Also, did not get to work A fuctionallity. 

##Test cases values tested in this lab was as following:

For testing we had to get messages in our results. Capt. Trimble checked my both required and B functionalities. 

##Demonstartions: 
Prelab --> 5 points (not done)

Required functionality --> 35 points (on time)

B functionality   --> 10 points (on time)

A functionality --> 0 points (not done)

##Documentation
I used the Dr. Coulston handouts from class as well as MSP430 family user's guide. Also, I used internet to find how to do jumps and other peoples programs to find out how to properly increment location and make better program flow.
